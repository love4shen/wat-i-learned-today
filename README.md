* to use Google Chrome Canary for debugging React Native, change `google chrome` to `google chrome cacanry` in `case 'darwin': return 'google chrome';` in `./node_modules/react-native/local-cli/server/middleware/getDevToolsMiddleware.js`
* `#(single-expression)` use `%1`(`%`), `%2` for args: syntax sugar, same as `(fn (args) expressions)`

* `Function.prototype.length`: number of args expected by the funtion, replacing `arity`
* visuallly hidden (from [H5BP](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css))

```
/*
 * Hide only visually, but have it available for screen readers:

* `~~3.14 = 3`, any applicable usage?
* diff document load event & document ready event: ready fires when the html load has completed and the DOM is ready; load fires when image other page content have all finished loading
* DOM event delegation: a mechanism of responding to ui-events via a single common parent rather than each child, through the magic of event "bubbling" (aka event propagation) [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687296/what-is-dom-event-delegation)

* [The Life-Cycle of a Composite Component](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/shared/reconciler/ReactCompositeComponent.js)

```
/**
 * ------------------ The Life-Cycle of a Composite Component ------------------
 *
 * - constructor: Initialization of state. The instance is now retained.
 *   - componentWillMount
 *   - render
 *   - [children's constructors]
 *     - [children's componentWillMount and render]
 *     - [children's componentDidMount]
 *     - componentDidMount
 *
 *       Update Phases:
 *       - componentWillReceiveProps (only called if parent updated)
 *       - shouldComponentUpdate
 *         - componentWillUpdate
 *           - render
 *           - [children's constructors or receive props phases]
 *         - componentDidUpdate
 *
 *     - componentWillUnmount
 *     - [children's componentWillUnmount]
 *   - [children destroyed]
 * - (destroyed): The instance is now blank, released by React and ready for GC.
